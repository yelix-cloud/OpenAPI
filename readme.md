> This JSR registry is taken because of Yelix's future plans to support it, for now Yelix uses OpenAPI layer inside Yelix without an internal or external library.

# Yelix OpenAPI Registry

This is a registry for Yelix OpenAPI, which is a wrapper around the OpenAPI specification. It allows you to define your API in a simple and easy-to-read format, and then generate client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation from it.
